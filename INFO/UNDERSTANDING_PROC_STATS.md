        **TASK_COMM_LEN** (16) characters (including the
        terminating null byte) are silently truncated.

_Umask_  Process umask, expressed in octal with a leading
        zero; see [umask(2)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umask.2.html).  (Since Linux 4.7.)

        (running)", "S (sleeping)", "D (disk sleep)", "T
        (stopped)", "t (tracing stop)", "Z (zombie)", or "X
        (dead)".

_Tgid_   Thread group ID (i.e., Process ID).

_Ngid_   NUMA group ID (0 if none; since Linux 3.13).

        allocated.

_NStgid_ Thread group ID (i.e., PID) in each of the PID
        namespaces of which _[pid]_ is a member.  The
        leftmost entry shows the value with respect to the
        PID namespace of the process that mounted this
        procfs (or the root namespace if mounted by the
        kernel), followed by the value in successively
        nested inner namespaces.  (Since Linux 4.1.)

_NSpid_  Thread ID in each of the PID namespaces of which
        _[pid]_ is a member.  The fields are ordered as for
        _NStgid_.  (Since Linux 4.1.)

_NSpgid_ Process group ID in each of the PID namespaces of
        which _[pid]_ is a member.  The fields are ordered as
        for _NStgid_.  (Since Linux 4.1.)

_NSsid_  descendant namespace session ID hierarchy Session
        ID in each of the PID namespaces of which _[pid]_ is
        a member.  The fields are ordered as for _NStgid_.
        (Since Linux 4.1.)

_VmPeak_ Peak virtual memory size.

_VmSize_ Virtual memory size.

_VmLck_  Locked memory size (see [mlock(2)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html)).

_VmPin_  Pinned memory size (since Linux 3.2).  These are
        pages that can't be moved because something needs
        to directly access physical memory.

_VmHWM_  Peak resident set size ("high water mark").  This
        value is inaccurate; see _/proc/[pid]/statm_ above.

_VmRSS_  Resident set size.  Note that the value here is the
        sum of _RssAnon_, _RssFile_, and _RssShmem_.  This value
        is inaccurate; see _/proc/[pid]/statm_ above.

_RssAnon_
        Size of resident anonymous memory.  (since Linux
        4.5).  This value is inaccurate; see
        _/proc/[pid]/statm_ above.

_RssFile_
        Size of resident file mappings.  (since Linux 4.5).
        This value is inaccurate; see _/proc/[pid]/statm_
        above.

_RssShmem_
        Size of resident shared memory (includes System V
        shared memory, mappings from [tmpfs(5)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html), and shared
        anonymous mappings).  (since Linux 4.5).

_VmData_, _VmStk_, _VmExe_

        is inaccurate; see _/proc/[pid]/statm_ above.

_VmLib_  Shared library code size.

_VmPTE_  Page table entries size (since Linux 2.6.10).

_VmPMD_  Size of second-level page tables (added in Linux
        4.0; removed in Linux 4.15).

_VmSwap_ Swapped-out virtual memory size by anonymous
        private pages; shmem swap usage is not included
        (since Linux 2.6.34).  This value is inaccurate;
        see _/proc/[pid]/statm_ above.

_HugetlbPages_
        Size of hugetlb memory portions (since Linux 4.4).

_CoreDumping_
        Contains the value 1 if the process is currently
        dumping core, and 0 if it is not (since Linux
        4.15).  This information can be used by a
        monitoring process to avoid killing a process that
        is currently dumping core, which could result in a
        corrupted core dump file.

_Threads_
        Number of threads in process containing this
        thread.

_SigQ_   This field contains two slash-separated numbers

        of this process.  The first of these is the number
        of currently queued signals for this real user ID,
        and the second is the resource limit on the number
        of queued signals for this process (see the
        description of **RLIMIT_SIGPENDING** in [getrlimit(2)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html)).

        enabled in inheritable, permitted, and effective
        sets (see [capabilities(7)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)).

        Seccomp mode of the process (since Linux 3.8, see
        [seccomp(2)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html)).  0 means **SECCOMP_MODE_DISABLED**; 1
        means **SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT**; 2 means
        **SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER**.  This field is provided only
        if the kernel was built with the **CONFIG_SECCOMP**
        kernel configuration option enabled.

_Speculation_Store_Bypass_
        Speculation flaw mitigation state (since Linux
        4.17, see [prctl(2)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html)).
