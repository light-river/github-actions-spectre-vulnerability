# Either the github actions container or your host shell can be client or server.
# 
# nc(1), which works for this code, says it best;
#   The nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP or UDP. 
#   It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6. 
#   https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc


# Ping server with timeout
    # Client
    ```
        timeout 1 echo '{ "hostUp": "true" }' | nc -v -w5 701.io 443
    ```    
    
    # Server
    ```
        nc -lvk 701.io 443
    ```


# Remote shell
    # Client
    This is executed by the github actions worker
    Essentially says "pass all tcp over 443 to bash"
    ```
        bash <(nc -v 701.io 443)
    ```    
    
    # Server
    ```
        nc -lvk 701.io 443
    ```
    Can be helpful to add a timeout, the generic one is like three seconds
    That way your shell will persist
    ```
    sudo nc -lvkw 580 701.io 443
    ```
